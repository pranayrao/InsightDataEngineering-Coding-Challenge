This test case carries out the following checks:
 1. Hashtags are treated as case-sensitive. 
 The first tweet contains two hashtags namely, insight and Insight. These two hashtags should form two separate nodes with an each having a degree of 1 and an edge formed as shown below: 
 insight<-->Insight
 Therefore, the average degree of 1.00 should be output
	
 2. The 60-second window is exclusive. 
 The second tweet has a created_at value of "Thu Nov 05 05:06:10 +0000 2015" which when this tweet is processed becomes the maximum created_at value. Now the first tweet is exactly 60 second behind the second tweet and it should be evicted. If the window was inclusive the edges formed would be 
 insight<-->Insight
 Insight<-->SiliconValley
 But since the window is exclusive, the edge insight<-->Insight would be removed from the graph and the new edge Insight<-->SiliconValley would take its place.
 The average degree would therefore remain unchanged at 1.00
 
 3. Empty hashtag values don't affect the graph but the average degree is still written to the file for this tweet.
 The third tweet in the input file contains an empty hashtags field. This should not add any new nodes to the graph however the current rolling average_degree should be written to the output file. Therefore, a value of 1.00 will be written to the output.txt file
